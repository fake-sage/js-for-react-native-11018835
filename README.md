# Array and User Info Manipulation

This assignment includes three main tasks involving JavaScript functions to manipulate arrays and create user profiles. Below is a brief explanation of each task:

### Task 1: Process Array
**File:** `arrayManipulation.js`

- **Function:** `processArray`
- **Description:** This function takes an array of numbers as an argument and returns a new array where each even number is squared and each odd number is tripled.

### Task 2: Format Array Strings
**File:** `arrayManipulation.js`

- **Function:** `formatArrayStrings`
- **Description:** This function takes two arrays as arguments: an array of strings and an array of numbers processed by `processArray`. It modifies each string based on its corresponding number. If the number is even, the entire string is capitalized. If the number is odd, the string is converted to lowercase.

### Task 3: Create User Profiles
**File:** `userInfo.js`

- **Function:** `createUserProfiles`
- **Description:** This function takes an array of original names and an array of modified names from Task 2. It returns an array of objects, each containing `originalName`, `modifiedName`, and an auto-incremented `id` starting from 1.

This assignment demonstrates various array manipulations and the creation of structured user profile objects in JavaScript.
